Apply Don't Repeat Yourself coding princicples

Provide 2 tests
    - cover a different section of the application
    - state what is being tested
    - provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

Outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of application

Utilise githup, make commits

Utilise dev to faciliate the execution of the application
- write a script which turns application into an exectuable
