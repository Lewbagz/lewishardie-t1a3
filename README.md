## Features

Master Password access and hashing

Password Generation

Account Management


### Outline

The terminal app created uses a Command line interface, this app asks a user to register their username and password and then allows the user to login. Once logging in the user will be given access to the password manager at which point the user will be able to add a website/account with the associated username and email, at which the point the app asks the user for the password requirements, i.e. password min length and password max length. The app will automatically generate a password for the user that consists of randomly generated characters from letters to symbols.

The user will be able to access this password by selecting get password, the password isn't shown to the user at any time, but will be copied straight to the users clipboard.


variables and the concept of variable score
loops and conitional control structures
error handling


## Implementation


creater a master password to gain access, that validates user

create a password generator

## Style Guide

Pep 8 style guide for python code

Indentation,
4 spaces per indentation level.
These spaces were achieved with a single tab through out the code

surround top-level function definitions with two blank lines

single blank line used to seperate groups of related functions

imports on seperate lines and located at the top of the file




## Configure

### Master Password
- User inputs a password during configuration
- The master password is hashed and saved in a file



###

## Add new Accounts
- Ask for master password
- Validate master password
- User input email, username and website
- password uses a random password generator to generate a password for the account



## Retreive Passwords for an app

- hide passwords
- copy password to clipboard


requirements

Implementation
- variables and variable scope
- loops and conditional control structures
- write and utilise simple functions
- error handling
- input and output
- importing a python package
- using functions frmo a python package

Apply Don't Repeat Yourself coding princicples

Provide 2 tests
    - cover a different section of the application
    - state what is being tested
    - provide at least TWO test cases and the expected results for each test case

Outline of the testing procedure and cases should be included with the source code of application

Utilise githup, make commits

Utilise dev to faciliate the execution of the application
- write a script which turns application into an exectuable
